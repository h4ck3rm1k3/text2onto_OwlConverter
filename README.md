OwlConverter
============

This is a small converter for turning the exported xml/rdf files of text2onto
(see https://code.google.com/p/text2onto/) into "real" ontologies.
"Real" meaning ontologies where all the entities are connected amongst themselves,
instead of beeing just connected to one of the big entities (Instances, Concepts, ...).

Tested with text2onto versions 070917 and 071109.
